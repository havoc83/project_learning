# project_learning
This repository is used to hold most of my "learning" based projects, projects where the main focus is on learning a new skill or concept as opposed to building something production ready.
The idea is to simulate all skills that would be covered in a classic computer science bachlors and masters program.  
Since I have been programming professionally for a few years, most of the introductory concepts have been skipped.
## Structure
Each concept (or what would be a course in a traditional degree) has been broken into a separate directory.  
Each directory will also contain a README file covering the learning objective and resources used.  The number of
projects largely depends on the overall project size and objective, very specific objectives might have a single large project
while broader topics might have several smaller projects covering a wide array of objectives.
## Philosophy
The idea was not to produce perfect production ready code for each project but instead to ensure that the learning objective is covered and understood.  
Sometimes a less ideal way to do something might be used (for instance recusion) simply to assist the learning process.  
The inspiration for putting this together was to depart from traditional class work in favor of a more hands on approach, 
resources (i.e. lectures or books) should only be utilized to get enough information to where the project can be started and then used a reference while building.
The entire program is built on a complete understanding computer science, so in most cases lower level (c, c++) or academic languages (haskell) are used when possible.
